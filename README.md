# Math Problem Solver

This is an Undergraduate Research project by Morgan Allen. The goal of this project is to turn handwritten, worked-out math equations into computer written equations 
that can then be graded and flagged by the computer as correct or incorrect.



Thank you to my mentor, Paul Savala, and St. Edward's University Math Department for their continued support and guidance.
