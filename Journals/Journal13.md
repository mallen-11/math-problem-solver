# Journal for Week 13 (due 11/23)

1. How did the proposal talk go?

I think my talk went really well. First talking about content, I think my content was the perfect mix of in depth thought but in simplistic terms. I was really happy about
how it went. In regards to how I spoke. I felt confident throughout the talk and calm. Sometimes if someone is rushing I think their talks can be confusing, but I felt I 
was steady throughout my talk.

2. What did you do this week? Please be as specific as possible by filling out the time
sheet provided below.

This week I worked on my presentation mostly as well as some on fixing the errors in the image captioning model. 

Monday-Friday: 2 hours: Worked on presentation

Friday and Saturday: 4 hours: Worked on Model


A few things I discovered:

- You can only feed preprocessed images into the evaluate that is why the error shows up.
- I am still confused on how to split the training and testing sets but I am working on it.
- Argpartition isn't doing what it said it was going to do so I need some help here as well.

3. What have you done for your proposal paper? What do you still need to do?

I haven't done too much so far. I have all my thoughts together on what I need to talk about now I just have to start writing.

4. What questions do you have for me? What do you need from me to progress further?

We just need to talk about the errors in my model and work through those.
