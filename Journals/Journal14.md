# Journal for Week 14 (due 11/30)
1. What did you do this week? Please be as specific as possible by filling out the time
sheet provided below.

I didn't do much this week related to coding just because with Thanksgiving I took a break, but I did do a few things. First, I went through and identified the 
issues that I need to fix in the image captioning with attention code. I also started to outline my proposal paper for MATH 4157A. Lastly, I begun to do some
research on object detection just out of my own curiousity. I am mentioning it because I thought it could be useful down the road but I haven't done anything
with it yet.

Tuesday- Worked on Model: 1 hour

Sunday- Paper and Research: 2 hours


2. What questions do you have for me? What do you need from me to progress further?

No questions as of right now. I will let you know if any of them come up this week when I work on my paper.

3. What is your plan for next semester? What would you like to try first?

My plan is to start working and researching new ideas for image captioning with attention. Specifically looking at different forms of attention and how we can
make them better.
