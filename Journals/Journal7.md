# Journal for Week 7 (due 10/12):

1. Please take a moment to reflect on the writing workshop on 10/9: How are math papers
different from papers you’ve written for other courses? How are they similar? What are some elements of “good” math writing to keep in mind when you write your proposal? 
What are some elements of “bad” math writing that you should try to avoid?

The difference between math papers and any other english paper is the elegance factor. The idea behind a math paper is tell a story behind why you think this matters
and how it relates to multiple disciplines. They are similar in the aspects of appealing to an audience. All papers must be written with an audience in mind. Once
you have that audience you must appeal to them and make them want to read and understand. Mathematical papers are for math people. Good math writing is concise and clear.
Simply put, they must be easily understandable and readable without making things over complicated. With all science, it must be replicable. We need to keep that in mind when
writing a paper because you want people to understand why and how this was done. In a math paper you should avoid formula dumping. No math paper is readable with a
bunch of formulas and functions. There needs to be explanations and a sample of formulas that are most needed for the best understanding. People understand words not
variables.

2. What did you do this week? Please be as specific as possible by filling out the time sheet provided below.

This week I worked on two main things. I worked on the Letters, Digits, Math Operators Model where we loaded all of these things and I was trying to get the model to train at a high accuracy.
I was able to get it pretty high. The only thing it lacks is more training data. With that I could affectively use data augmenetation and get a little better accuracy.
The other thing I did was image splitting. It worked really well and I am proud of it for sure.

Time Sheet:

Everyday I spent about an hour working on all of this. 

**Friday**: Published Image Splitting to Github

**Saturday**: Worked on Model some more for about an hour and a half

**Sunday**: Worked on Image Splitting for fractions and exponents


3. What questions do you have for me? What do you need from me to progress further?

I don't really have many questions this week. My work was straightforward.


4. What is your plan for next week?

This next week I think our plans is for me to work on Seq2Seq or at least start looking at that. I also am going to continue to work on the Desmos page for SGD.
