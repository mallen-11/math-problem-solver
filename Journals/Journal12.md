#Journal for Week 12 (due 11/16)

1. What did you do this week? Please be as specific as possible by filling out the time
sheet provided below.

This week was very productive and great. I worked solely on understanding and getting to work the image captioning with attention model. It all worked so well.

Tuesday-Friday: Worked Periodically

Saturday: 12-4: Finished getting the model to work


2. Give a very rough outline of your proposal paper. When doing this, start with the
research problem, then work your way up to the background, then introduction.

- Research Problem: Creating a model that can predict and solve handwritten math problems. As well as coming up with new ways to have a model read handwritting.
- Background: Neural Network's, CNN's, RNN's and Seq2Seq
- Introduction: Background about why we care about predicting handwriting and what has already been done (MNIST and CHROME).


3. What questions do you have for me? What do you need from me to progress further?

I have no questions right now. I am excited to show you the work done for this model.
