# Journal for Week 5 (due 9/28)

1. What did you do this week? Please be as specific as possible by filling out the time
sheet provided below.

This week I tried to implement Data Augmentation and Batch Normalization into my existing model. I also made a new data set with letters and numbers and tried it 
on that. Lastly, I tried to do transfer learning. All of these things did not go well and I need some help. Transfer learning I am not sure is possible because of
the image size of MNIST. I have had a ton of trouble with that. I reached 99% without DA and BN but DA and BN helped some but not a ton.

Wednesday: 2-3pm Worked on making new dataset
Saturday: 6-8pm Worked on Data Augmentation
Sunday: All Day Worked on Data Augmenetation and Transfer Learning (Unsuccessful)

2. What questions do you have for me? What do you need from me to progress further?

A lot. Mostly on how to get transfer learning to work. If you look at Transfer Learning Second Trial you can see I am very close to reshaping my data to be the right
shape but it is not there yet. I also don't think this new data set is good. I think it is already data augmented in ways I do not want. I have a lot of questions for sure.

3. What is your plan for next week?

Next week, I will most likely do a lot of the same stuff I did this week since I wasn't able to progress very far. Once I get some questions answered I should be on a better track.
