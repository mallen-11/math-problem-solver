1. What would you like to get out of research? This may be as simple as “getting credit to
graduate,” but try to think a little deeper.

    I would really like to get practical experience out of my research. The reason I wanted to work with Dr.Savala is because I didn't want to do research on something a regular person couldn't use or understand. Research on the data science side seems a lot more hands on and practical. At the end of my research, I want my model to be something that actually might make a difference in the world.
    
2. What are your current career goals/ideas?
    My current career interest are in data science or the actuary field which seem to be very similar. These fields are complex and require math, statistic, and coding skills which are all things I am passionate about. I like to see how data can create change, and I want my future job to be apart of that change. 
    
3. What are your favorite parts of your math courses (this could be topics or methods).
What are parts that you struggle with?

    My favorite parts of math courses are the complex problem solving parts. I enjoy solving hard problems with math. I especially enjoyed differential equations because a lot of what was done in there had a relation to the real world. I also really enjoy algorithms in discrete math. Algorithms are that perfect mix of coding and math, and I enjoyed learning about that. Certain areas I have struggled with was visualizing 3D graphs in Calculus 3. Sometimes I would have difficulty seeing the full picture when a graph was in 3D. Another area I struggled with at times was creating a full useful proof in Inquiry and Proof. A lot of times I seemed to have the right bits and pieces but never the entire proof. I know that that takes time but is something I struggled with.
