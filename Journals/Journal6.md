# Journal for Week 6 (due 10/5)

1. What did you do this week? Please be as specific as possible by filling out the time
sheet provided below.

Well this week was a hodge podge of things and progress was made but it seemed to a be a lot of small progress. I redid the Confusion Matrix Notebook looking at
the accuracy between switching the kernel size between 3, 5, and 7. Suprisingly 7 performed the best. I then changed my CNN around using a kernel size of 7 and got
an accuracy of 99.32 percent which is really good. I worked on both the CROHME data set from Kaggle and the dataset you sent me from the website earlier in the week. 
Both of these I ran into problems I will explain. The CROHME dataset from Kaggle I was able to download but every image is a INKML file. So I went on the github link
because it has a python script to convert this to a usable format. The issue is that when you try to download and run the commands from the github is that the requirements
are not the correct up to date ones. This makes it so that you cannot just run the script so I ran into a dead end there. Next, I looked at the website you had sent me with
the computer generated equations. I was able to download and load that data but I could only figure out how to do it in a list format (list of arrays). The arrays need
to be reshaped so we can use them for the models. If you look on Handwritten Math Problems First Notebook you can see where I get stuck. I need help figuring out what to
do from there. I also do not think those images are very good because they are super complex math formulas. You can see on the Notebook where I print one of them and 
it is very high level math formulas. I think we should look more into the dataset used by the link I sent you. That data seems more usable or we can make our own really simple
LaTeX written images. I started to look into setting up a visual Gradient Descent on Desmos as well. I think this is something I might want to work on next week some. 
There doesn't seem to be any publicly availabe which I found interesting. I might want to write an article on this for my LinkedIn. Lastly, for the rest of the day Sunday
I am going to go through the papers we talked about and possibly look for some more information there. One last thing is that I also tried to do more on the transfer learning
stuff and my notebook Transfer Learning Second Trial would not load the model. I was doing everything I had done before which worked so I am not sure what happened.

Thursday I think : for about 2 hours-  Worked on the Confusion Matrix stuff

Saturday: 1-3pm- Worked on Transfer Learning

Sunday: 8-11pm- Worked on CROHME and other dataset

Sunday: Rest of day- Read papers and other research


2. What questions do you have for me? What do you need from me to progress further?

I talk about a lot of the questions I have up there. I really just want to talk about why the Transfer Learning didn't work. Which dataset we should use? How to resize those images?
Thoughts on where we should go from here?

3. What is your plan for next week?

Next week work on the dataset we think I should focus on, possibly look at more papers, work on the desmos gradient descent, fix the transfer learning.
