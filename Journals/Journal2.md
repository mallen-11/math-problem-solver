# Journal 2
Journal for Week 2 (due 9/7)
1. What is the main goal of your article talk? What would you like the audience to know by
the end of the talk?

- The main goal for my article talk is to introduce everyone there to machine learning and the basic architecture of a neural network. I think giving my explanation
on what I am hoping in my personal research will help people understand the meaning behind what the neural network is used for. I hope at the end of my talk everyone
there leaves with an understanding of machine learning and why we need it. Also, I want them to begin to see the complexities of CNN's and how important they are
for image recognition.

2. What is your plan for the next week, after finishing preparing for your talk?

- Well, this weekend I am working towards understanding the equations better in regards to SGD and backpropogation. So I am really going to focus on getting a good 
grasp of those. Also I am really hoping to work more in the package ann_visualizer. I tried to work some in it on my own but I am getting path errors that I will probably 
need help with. Other than that, I will continue to code and learn more about Python and TensorFlow.
