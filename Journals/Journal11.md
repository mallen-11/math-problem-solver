# Journal for Week 11 (due 11/9)

1. What did you do this week? Please be as specific as possible by filling out the time
sheet provided below.

This week I worked on building a encoder decoder model for image captioning. I mostly spent time working through the tensorflow example at this website https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/text/image_captioning
I was able to load the data well and work through it all well. An issue arose in running each image to identify the features. Everything else I think would have worked had I been able to do this.
I have a few ideas for simplicity I want to run by you so I can try them this coming week. I also read the paper on attention at this link https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.0473.pdf. I think it 
was really interesting and I was able to learn a lot from it.

Friday- Worked on Encoder-Decoder Model- 2 hours

Saturday- More Model -2 hours

Sunday- More Model and Reading- 3 hours


2. What questions do you have for me? What do you need from me to progress further?

I think instead of using inceptionv3 for the feature extraction I might want to try one of my models for simplicity. I want to hear your thoughts on this. Other than that,
I need you to help me fix this one main issue in the notebook I have now so I can possibly get it working.


3. What is your plan for next week?

Keep working on the encoder-decoder model and start working on my presentation for next week.
