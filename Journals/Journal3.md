# Journal 3

Journal for Week 3 (due 9/14)

1. Reflect on your talk: What did you do well? What do you think you should work on for the
next talk?

I really felt like I answered the questions well. Another thing I thought I did well was keeping my presentation simple enough to understand and still getting the 
point across. One area where I felt other people lacked was just putting equations up there and trying to explain them. I felt like I made it easy to understand. I think 
I can work on my enthusiasm during my talks like you pointed out before. If I can make my talks more engaging for the audience, I think I will be on a good track.

2. What did you read this week? Give a really brief summary of what you read.

I reread the first paper 'Convolutional Neural Networks' again. I also read the backprop example problem article a few times times to really gain that understanding.
From those articles, I really feel like I am gaining a nice base into what is happening behind the scenes in a neural network.

3. What questions do you have for me?

What should be my game plan for reading the rest of the semester? What is the outlook for the semester now that the first presentation is over?

4. What would you like to do next? Would you like to keep exploring this topic, or switch
gears?

Definitely keep exploring this topic. I think diving into convolutional neural networks and adding in symbols and letters is going to be the next step for sure.
I am excited to get started with this.

5. Dr. Mitch will be doing a software workshop next week on using LaTeX (i.e. Overleaf).
What areas of Overleaf do you need help with? What are you proficient at?

I need help in beamer. I am just not very familiar with all the notation and syntax. I am relatively proficient in regular LaTeX like for a piece of paper not a
slide presentation. I assume a lot of the stuff for equations is the same for both but I would really like to see more on the syntax for the setup on beamer.
