# Journal 1 (8/31)
1. Please take a moment to reflect on the talk workshop on 10/28: How are talks different
from speeches? Reflect on your previous experiences with public speaking: What do you think are your strengths? What are your weaknesses? What would you like to improve? How can I help you succeed?

- Talks are different than speeches because speeches are talking at someone in a way. A talk is a conversation where you are teaching somebody something about your research. I think I have strength in confidence with my speaking and the knowledge
I have on topics. Both of these things are strengths because they give me the ability to talk about topics more openly whereas if I was confused then I would shy away from speaking. I would say a weakness for me
in public speaking is that sometimes I feel that I rush myself and that causes my mind to get jumbled with ideas. A lot of times I have trouble finding words because I have so many ideas in my head at that moment.
I would like to improve my overall speaking abilities. Being a great speaker is really a great talent and it is something I hope to one day possess. I feel like you can help me succeed by encouraging me to practice a lot.
Another thing you can do, is help me learn how to pause better in my speaking so that my mind and mouth have time to get in sync with eachother.

2. What did you read this week? Give a really brief summary of what you read.

- This week I picked the three articles I want to read this semester. The first paper I read was one of my side papers. It is called "Analyzing Mathematical Reasoning Abilities of Neural Models." This paper was difficult to read but I worked my way through it.
This paper is about a few researchers trying to develop a deep learning model that can answer mostly any math problem. They said their hopes for this model was that it would one day be able to make up its own equations and
create new math we have never seen before. In the end, their model didn't do much but had the layout of a promising start. 

- The second paper I started reading was my main paper. I read the first 10 pages and plan to reread it again before Monday as parts of it are confusing. I get caught up on the equations mostly when reading.
Anyways, I learned about tensors for the first time which seems to be a group of matrices or a matrix of matrices. That must be where TensorFlow comes from. Next, the paper talked about CNN's. First
it discussed structure specifically how there are layers of pooling and convolutions. These help the images to be more recognizable for the model. The paper also talked about the loss function which I feel
relatively familiar with now. We will probably end up using the Cross-Entropy Loss Function in my project. Next, it talked about Stochastic Gradient Descen. SGD is all about slowly using the previous predictions
to guess closer and closer to find the right parameters for your model to succeed in the end. I read once that the best way to think about SGD is a person slowly sliding down a hole. Each step they take is an epoch and they
are reaching with their foot to find the bottom guessing each time where it is and getting closer based on the incline of the previous step. Lastly, the paper talked about Back Propogation. This is where you are going backwards
in your neural network computing the error between each nueron. The error will hopefully help you fine tune the weights of each nueron to make the model the best it can be.

3. What questions do you have for me?

- I have a lot of questions as far as the equations of all of the stuff above. Also I would like you to explain to me more about Tensors and what they might look like. Another question I have is what parts of all that I have
read should go into my presentation. I feel the equation might be too confusing for people to want to learn about so possibly the basics of CNN's might be good? I am not sure and am curious what you think.
