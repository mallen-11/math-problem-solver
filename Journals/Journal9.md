# Journal for Week 9 (due 10/26)


1. What did you do this week? Please be as specific as possible by filling out the time
sheet provided below.

This week I mostly worked on reading through a few papers and building both a neural network from scratch with numpy for practice and then the beginning of an LSTM
with numpy. The few papers I looked through were about image captioning and LSTM's which helped me gain a more broad understanding of LSTM's. The numpy neural network
was taken from the website you had sent me that walks through it. It was very helpful and helped me remember a lot about neural networks. The LSTM one, I found a website
from the original paper you sent me. It helped me go through the forward pass. I stopped there because the backward pass was confusing and I couldn't find much help in 
understanding it.

Friday: 8-10:30pm - Worked on the Numpy Neural Network and LSTM

Saturday and Sunday for about an hour each - Work on the LSTM with Numpy



2. What questions do you have for me? What do you need from me to progress further?

Hopefully you can help me understand the backward pass for LSTM a little better. I am sure it is similar to error back propagation from regular neural networks.


3. What is your plan for next week?

Possibly work on some image captioning stuff using RNN's.
