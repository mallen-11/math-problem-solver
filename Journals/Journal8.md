# Journal for Week 8 (due 10/19)

1. What did you do this week? Please be as specific as possible by filling out the time sheet
provided below.

 I looked at papers that gave in introduction to Seq2Seq and Recurrent Neural Networks. I also worked on developing a RNN to write poetry. The RNN turned out well
 and I got it working. It just spits out gibberish. I wonder if its because a lack of training values or too small of an RNN.

Friday: Read papers for about an hour


Saturday: Looked at more papers for about an hour


Sunday: Worked on Poem_RNN


2. What questions do you have for me? What do you need from me to progress further?

I would like to walk through Poem_RNN just so I can get it working as well as learn it better. I feel I have a basic understanding of RNN's and Seq2Seq.

3. What is your plan for next week?

I will keep working on Seq2Seq models and finishing up the Poem_RNN model.
