#Journal for Week 10 (due 11/2): 

Weâ€™re going to start preparing for your proposal talk this week.
1. Reflect again on your previous experiences with public speaking: What do you think are
your strengths? What are your weaknesses? What would you like to improve? How can I
help you succeed?

I think my previous experiences have gone well. I think I just need to try to stay calm and talk clearly. I often use a lot of filler words and I would
like to cut down on that. I feel one of my strengths especially with this project is we are only presenting a sliver of the work so I have a lot of extra 
knowledge. I would like to improve on cutting out filler words. I also feel the more prepared I am the better I do so I am going to try to be as prepared
as possible. Plus the 3439 project presentations have helped me with giving zoom presentations.



2. What did you do this week? Please be as specific as possible by filling out the time
sheet provided below.

This week I worked on building a few more RNN model's. It went really well. I have a few questions on the predictions but I got it working well and I am proud of it.
I also read the Show, Attend, Tell article as well as some of the Image one. I understood it really well and found it interesting. Laslty, I worked on the
pseudocode for the LSTM backpropagation. That also went well.

Friday: Read Papers and RNN Models

Saturday: RNN Models

Sunday: LSTM BackPropagation

3. What questions do you have for me? What do you need from me to progress further?

None as of right now. Just ready to talk about the papers and models.

4. What is your plan for next week?

Probably read more of these papers to get a better understanding and maybe work on some CNN and RNN for image captioning.
